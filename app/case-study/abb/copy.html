<h3 class="">The project's high-level context</h3>
<h4 class="sub-headline">Initial problem statement</h4>
<p class="">
  The project is about an excel sheet, which needs to be converted into
  a web application. The excel workbook has mainly 3 key sheets with a
  large number of columns to be displayed. Later we will know that the
  high level objective is to avoid long side scroll which is the root
  cause of alot small problems.

<h2 class="">How we designed the web layout.</h2>
<p class="">
  Before moving pixels, I like to exchange thoughts, fun and fear
  factors, likes and dislikes. Making my user really comfortable. This
  helps answer the following questions (sometimes).
</p>
</r-cell>

<r-cell span-s="row" span="4" class="section fade fadeOut">
<h3>How are people interacting with the current product?</h3>
<p>
  After interviewing 3-5 users, I noticed the excel workbook has - 8
  sheets. Users frequently interact with 3 key sheets - LSU, Drive Point
  MD, and Transformer. Main challenge is to minimize horizontal scroll.
</p>
<p>
  Drive Point MD (one of the key sheets) has 154 columns. To see all the
  content, you will need 4-5 laptops side by side, all zoomed at 85%.

<h3>What factors are affecting user's productivity?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    It was very obvious that all these sheets were having a lot of empty
    columns. Many of the columns were having repeating values in them.
  </li>
  <li>
    The columns were grouped logically - Input, Output-1, Reference
    data, Output 2. Buttons to show/hide these column groups were very
    small, roughly about 8x8 px.
  </li>
  <li>font size was 8pt @85% zoom level</li>
  <li>cell size was about 62x21 px</li>

<h3>What things users like about the product?</h3>
<p>
  The ability to copy and edit multiple cell data at once. Click and
  hold to select data and perform quick functions like incremental
  repeat, bulk find and replace, search etc.
</p>
</r-cell>

<r-cell span-s="row" span="4" class="section fade fadeOut">
<h3>What makes them worried?</h3>
<p>
  The users I interviewed were excited but not all of them. Some of them
  were worried as they were already comfortable using the existing
  product. Their concerns were mainly “xenophobia” , fear of the
  unfamiliar or unknown. I spent more time with these users as they knew
  the ins and outs of the product, even bugs and glitches.

<!-- section problem-statement -->

<r-cell span-s="row" span="4" class="fade fadeOut">
<h2 class="">Let’s reframe problem statement</h2>
<p class="">
  Users at Abb are constantly zooming in & out, scrolling left and right
  and are struggling to find the appropriate content because the
  existing product has a really long side scroll, the cell and font size
  is very small, important data is off canvas, which makes comparing and
  editing data difficult. If we can solve this problem, it would impact
  users at ABB very positively, they will be able to focus more on the
  work and do their task with ease.

<h3 class="">1. Logically hide empty or irrelevant columns.</h3>
<p class="">
  Depending on the project some columns will never be used. So first we
  define project type - based on project type hide Irrelevant and empty
  columns.

<h3 class="">2. Multiple views</h3>
<p class="">
  After hiding the empty & irrelevant columns, it’s much easier to work.
  But the side scroll still exists. So if the user wants to compare
  input with output 2, they still will have to scroll all the way to the
  right. To minimize this issue, we created the prebuilt layout.

  3. Better & easier way to hide columns and col-groups using
  mouse/trackpad
</h3>
<p class="">
  Almost all the users were heavily using the mouse or the laptop
  trackpad to navigate. So instead of hiding a column group, We came up
  with a way to minimize the group. When a user double taps the column
  group name, it shrinks it’s width which is still visible and can be
  expanded again by double tapping on it.
