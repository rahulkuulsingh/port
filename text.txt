      and common on for alomost all the experiemnts. Probem is, this can't be
      done, well not 100% but it we definatley few things common such as the
      layout elements like - Howq the user navigate s the experimets, The way
      will see thge progress, The way they will interact witht differenty
      materials, aparatus, equipments, The way we show errors. What are they

      focus, they will go back and forth, they will make mistakes, they will
      search for things, they may accidently close be afraid of losing progess,
      they be frustrated if they lose grade points because they got confused,
      they will try to cheat, defate the system. They will need guidance, they
      will need help. They may get curious.
